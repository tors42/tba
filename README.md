# Team Battle Announcer

Desktop application which monitors a team in a [Lichess](https://lichess.org/)
team battle, and shows noteworthy events.  

The noteworthy events are shown in a dedicated window, but can also be shown on
a locally hosted Web Page - making it feasable for use as an video overlay, i.e
OBS Browser Source.

# Releases

The latest version of the application is available for download for Windows,
Mac and Linux at https://github.com/tors42/tba/releases/latest

Unzipping the downloaded archive will create a directory `tba-<version>`
and the application can be launched from a command-line terminal with
`tba-<version>/bin/tba`
